## What we did

- Estimation of Coefficients for an SIR Metapopulation model using linear regression over finite difference equations in Succeptible, Infected and Removed People. The objective was to calculate R_0 and D_I. (George and Efehan)

- Flight schedules data extraction from [flirt.eha.io](https://flirt.eha.io/) by exploiting the app framework's data-layer using [Meteor Methods](https://guide.meteor.com/methods.html). Refer to `Data/flirt.eha.io` for more information. (Lavneet)
- mongoDB queues for transformating data to relevant information (Lavneet)
