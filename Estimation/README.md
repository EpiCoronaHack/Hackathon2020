# Estimate Outbreak Parameters

## Introduction

## Some analyses of this outbreak, where code is available or feasible to write

[Imperial College London's MRC Centre for Outbreak analysis report 4](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-2019-nCoV-severity-10-02-2020.pdf). This report estimates the case fatality rate (CFR) of coronavirus cases in Hubei province, elsewhere in China, and internationally. Using a Bayesian approach, they estimate the disease onset-to-recovery time and onset-to-death time distributions. They continue to estimate the CFR using a stastistical model. Required data is linked at the end of the report. 

[Christian Althaus' CFR estimate](https://github.com/calthaus/ncov-cfr). Christian Althaus, University of Bern, has estimated a preliminary case fatality rate based on (the previous total of) 1 observed nCoV death outside of China. Maximum likelihood estimation is used to fit a statistical model for the number of observed deaths to the data. This approach could be updated with more recent data.
