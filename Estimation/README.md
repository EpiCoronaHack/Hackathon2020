# Estimate Outbreak Parameters

## Introduction

## Some analyses of this outbreak, where code is available or feasible to write

[Imperial College London's MRC Centre for Outbreak analysis report 4](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-2019-nCoV-severity-10-02-2020.pdf). This report estimates the case fatality rate (CFR) of coronavirus cases in Hubei province, elsewhere in China, and internationally. Using a Bayesian approach, they estimate the disease onset-to-recovery time and onset-to-death time distributions. They continue to estimate the CFR using a stastistical model. Required data is linked at the end of the report.
