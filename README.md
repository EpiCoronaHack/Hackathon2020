# EpiCoronaHack 2020

Curious about the novel coronavirus that has been in the news? Wondering how worried you should be? Want to learn how researchers estimate the incubation period, transmissibility and other key features of this emerging outbreak? Want to make your own estimates, models, and forecasts and see what you find? 

The MAGPIE research group, supported by PIMS and CANSSI, is hosting a hackathon called EpiCoronaHack. Come and join us to explore data analysis, epidemic modelling, inference, and simulation with the available coronavirus data. 

All are welcome! But some knowledge of at least one of the following is strongly recommended:  

- Mathematics: ODEs, mathematical modelling
- Statistics: stochastic models, statistical inference
- Computing: R, MATLAB, Python or similar
- Epidemiology, infectious disease modelling or outbreak analysis 

Date: Tuesday, February 18 and Wednesday, February 19, 2020

Time: 9:00am - 6:00pm on Feb. 18; 9:00am - 4:30pm on Feb. 19
